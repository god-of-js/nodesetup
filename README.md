## Reccomended setup for node express applications
I am not a fan of repitition hence I really dread going through the same process everytime I need a new node project my guess is that other developers go through the same stress ughhhn.
Anyway, not to worry I am providing a project template which you could start from with folder descriptive folder names and core dependencies I believe all node applications should contain.
feel free to make a pull request.
